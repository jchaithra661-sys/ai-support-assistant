Answer generation layer.

Two backends, chosen automatically:
  1. LLM mode  - if an OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set (and the `openai`
     package is installed), the retrieved FAQ snippets are stuffed into a prompt and
     a real LLM writes the final answer. This is "real" RAG generation.
  2. Template mode (default, no API key needed) - composes a clean answer directly
     from the top retrieved FAQ, adapts its tone to the detected sentiment, and is
     fully offline. This is what runs out-of-the-box so the whole project is
     demoable with zero setup and zero cost.

This split is the point worth explaining in an interview: you designed the system so
the *retrieval and business logic* (intent, sentiment, knowledge lookup) are
completely decoupled from *which* text-generation backend produces the final
sentence — swapping GPT for Claude, or for a local model, only touches this file.
